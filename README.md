# flashcard-app

This is a simple app that allows users to create flash cards for studying JavaScript. When a user hovers over a card with a question, the answer appears. When the user clicks the 'hit me' button, a new question will be randomly generated. 

It is made with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulations.
